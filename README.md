# Assignment 8 Final Project (Science)
# Hypothesis: The parallel hill climbing (PHC) method is a slower and less effective method of evolution than top k selection (TK) and parallel top k (PTK) selection, with top k selection being the fastest, but parallel top k selection being more effective long term. 

# Experiment
Utilize the three evolution algorithms (parallel hill climber, top k selection, and parallel top k selection) to evolve locomotion for a constant population size of 200, 50 generations, k value of 10, and for 10 trials each and compare which one is most effective at optimizing fitness. For a total of 300,000 simulated creatures.

# Evolution Algorithms
- Parallel hill climbing: This method performs hill climbing with 200 parents in parallel with one another. 
  200 Parents -> 200 Children -> For each child parent pair pick best one as next parent -> Repeat
  
- Top k selection: This method is more of a pool based method where the top performers each have 20 children and everyone competes against everyone
  200 Parents -> Top 10 selected -> 20 children each -> Evaluate Children -> Replace parents if children do better -> Repeat
  
- Parallel Top k selection: This method is similar to top k but is basically performing smaller population size top k with no cross over between sections
  10 Sections of 20 parents -> Top performer in each section selected -> Each section repopulated with children of top performer -> Repeat

# Evolution method
The aspects being evolved are:
- The number of links in the body
- The direction of the joints
- The placement and orientation of the connections
- The placement and number of sensors
- The weighted connections in the brain

# Body Generation
Bodies are generated by recursively branching off of itself in a tree like structure

# Brain Generation
Brains are generated by randomly connecting each sensor neuron to each motor neuron

# Mutation
Two weights in the brain are randomly changed

And there is a 20% chance new nodes are added or removed or both to the existing creature

The tree is generated recursively. Given a link it creates a random number of children links from it orthoganal to its surfaces, the lower the depth more likely it is to have children. The children links are connected via a joint with a random axis of rotation. Each link is randomly sized. Before children are added their absolute coordinates are checked to ensure they do not overlap with any existing links. Sensors are also randomly added to some links and their colors are green, non sensor links are blue.

#Example bodies (Link dimensions were set to constant of 1 to better illustrate the structure of the creatures)

# Fitness function
The fitness funtion used to evaluate the ability of the bots is the absolute value of the distance from the origin in the x, y plane.

# Results
Fitness plots for each of the three methods \n

In order to determine the effectiveness of the three evolution algorithms I plotted the average fitness for each method at each generation across the 10 trials. It is clear from these results that parallel top k is much less effective than both parallel hill climber and top k. The comparison between TK and PHC is more interesting though. The top k method is much faster at initially achieving high fitness levels, but the parallel hill climber has a more gradual but steady improvement in performance.

# Conclusion
Parallel hill climber is the best evolutionary algorithm over the long term, but in situations with limited time or compute power, top k will outperform.
