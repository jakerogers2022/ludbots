# Assignment 7 "The Creature"

# OVERVIEW: For this assignment I created a creature with a randomly generated creature

The creature is generated using a tree like structure.

The tree is generated recursively. Given a link it creates a random number of children links from it orthoganal to its surfaces, the lower the depth more likely it is to have children. The children links are connected via a joint with a random axis of rotation. Each link is randomly sized. Before children are added their absolute coordinates are checked to ensure they do not overlap with any existing links. Sensors are also randomly added to some links and their colors are green, non sensor links are blue.

#Example bodies (Link dimensions were set to constant of 1 to better illustrate the structure of the creatures)

# Brains
The brains are generated by initializing random weighted connections between sensor containing links and motors in the joints.
