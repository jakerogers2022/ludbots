# Assignment 8 "Evolved Body and Brain"

# OVERVIEW: For this assignment I created an evolved creature for locomotion.
The aspects being evolved are:
- The number of links in the body
- The direction of the joints
- The placement and orientation of the connections
- The placement and number of sensors
- The weighted connections in the brain

# Body Generation
Bodies are generated by recursively branching off of itself in a tree like structure

# Brain Generation
Brains are generated by randomly connecting each sensor neuron to each motor neuron

# Mutation
Two weights in the brain are randomly changed

And there is a 20% chance new nodes are added or removed or both to the existing creature

# Fitness function:
The fitness funtion used to evaluate the ability of the bots is the absolute value of the distance from the origin in the x, y plane.

      Top fitness in population of 200 over 50 generations

# Evolution Method:
I switched the evolution method away from parallel hill climbing to a more pool based evolution method.
For this I evaluated all parents and then selected the top 4 to reproduce all the children.

100 Parents -> Top 4 selected -> 25 children each -> Evaluate Children -> Replace parents if children do better -> Repeat

# Findings:
Some interesting findings were:
- It generally evolved to be smaller robots which made sense since the brains were more likely to be effective with less neurons to train
